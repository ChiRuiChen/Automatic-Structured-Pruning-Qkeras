# Automatic-Structured-Pruning
We have implemented a framework that supports developers in designing neural networks.
The framework is still under development and will be extended from time to time.

functions:
Prune from filter
Prune of neurons
Automatic pruning to minimum accuracy


Restrictions:
-There are only sqeuential Models Pruneable
-Tensorflow 2.1 to 2.3.1 is supported
